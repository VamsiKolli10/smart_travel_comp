Jira Tasks - VoxTrail

1. STAYS MODULE
   - Sync Stays search input with global travel context (auto-fill destination, lat/lng).
   - Persist resolved search destination (city, state, country, coordinates) back into context after every search.
   - Ensure quick location edits in Stays propagate to Emergency, Culture, and Destinations views.

2. EMERGENCY MODULE
   - Connect Emergency search to travel context: auto-populate city field and update context after manual searches.
   - Parse city vs. country from alias data so UI shows city in the text field and country in the dropdown.
   - Guard against concurrent edits (manual typing vs. auto-sync) using an `isManualEditing` flag.

3. CULTURE MODULE
   - Keep Cultural Guide inputs in sync with travel context without interrupting user typing.
   - Ensure Culture briefs consume the shared destination and language so changes elsewhere are reflected immediately.
   - Propagate Culture-driven updates (destination/culture/language) back into the context for downstream modules.

4. DESTINATIONS / DISCOVER MODULE
   - Prefill Discover search inputs using the shared travel context (city/country/coords).
   - Sync Discover searches back to the context so newly chosen locations update other features.
   - Handle context changes emitted by Stays/Emergency by refreshing Discover inputs without overwriting manual edits.
